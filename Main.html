        <h1>WELCOME TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h1>
<p>Software engineering as the name implies is about the engineering aspects of designing, developing and maintaining a software. It was introduced as a system to avoid development issues when building a software. In Software engineering, a software is developed correctly and consistently to meet its requirements within specified timeline and budget.</p>

<p>Just like in every other profession, let us take construction for example. If we were to build a house, we would need to plan how it would be built and we would start with designing the house structure and pattern on a piece of paper to provide guidelines to all personnel on the project. We would also need to assemble a team of architects, carpenters, builders who would also bring in their own tools and equipment such as tractors, and materials like sand, water, stones, wood etc, depending on the house specification. To make the house development successful, the whole team would need to work together for a certain period of time and every hand will be on deck to get the house built. After the house is built, a team of quality assurance will visit the house to check if the house is built according to approved specifications.</p>

<p>Software engineering is similar to the example in the paragraph above. To build a software project, it also requires planning, designing, developing, testing and maintaining the software within a specified project timeline.</p>
        <h2>DEVELOPER TOOLS</h2>
       <p> As software development industry has been constantly evolving to keep pace with the demand of the market, it is very important to note that there are a lot of softwares that you will or not discover. Well, this is said based on the fact that most developers follow trends in that if a developer tool is not popular, most developers do not just get to know it.</p>

<p>If clearly examined, you should know a popular developer tool is based on the law of “value and influence”, which are stratospheric laws.  in this regard, law of value can be viewed from the point of how much does it solve people’s problems for it to be a popular developer tool? For influence, it is dependent on the marketing strategies. However, the reason for this assertion is based on the fact that some unpopular developer tools are much more better than the popular ones, but can not be heard of based on ineffective marketing strategies.</p>

<p>Having explained that, our focus in this section is to explain to you what developer tools are, and also to list them for you to be well informed.  To begin with, what is a tool? A tool can be regarded as an instrument used to perform a task. In this premise, we are exploring those instruments used by developers to build their softwares. So in a nutshell, we can say that developer tools are those tools that enable developers to build their softwares.</p>
        <h3>INTRODUCTION TO HTML</h3>
       <p>Hypertext Markup Language, popularly known as HTML is the standard markup language for web pages designed to be displayed on a web browser.</p>

<p>Now let’s write some HTML texts and see how cool the language is.</p>

<p>Step 1 - Launch your code editor  i.e Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text or any of your favourite code editor. (see minimum specification requirements page)</p>
        <h4>VIRTUAL CLASS CSS</h4>
       <p> Now that we have learnt HTML and created a web page, let us take a look at how we can make our web pages prettier using CSS otherwise our web pages will look boring without it.</p>

<p>CSS means Cascading Style Sheet and it is used for making HTML documents look finer, because, by default most browsers will display your web pages with black text using Times New Roman font, and the other page contents such as lists, links, images, etc will appear in their default state.</p>

<p>We use CSS to make web pages look better and more appealing to our site visitors. To add CSS to a web page, you can add it directly to an HTML tag using the style attribute or in the  HEAD tag using the STYLE tag.</p>
